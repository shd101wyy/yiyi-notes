![Node CI Status](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/bubblewrap/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)

Bubblewrap is a Command Line Interface (CLI) that helps developers to create a Project for an Android application that launches an existing Progressive Web App (PWA) using a [Trusted Web Activity (TWA)](https://developers.google.com/web/android/trusted-web-activity/).

## Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 10.0 or above

## Setting up the Environment

### Get the Java Development Kit (JDK) 8.

The Android Command line tools requires the correct version of the JDK to run. To prevent version conflicts with a JDK version that is already installed, Bubblewrap uses a JDK that can unzipped in a separate folder.

Download a version of JDK 8 that is compatible with your OS from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot) and extract it in its own folder.

**Warning:** Using a version lower than 8 will make it impossible to compile the project and higher versions are incompatible with the Android command line tools.

### Get the Android command line tools

Download a version of Android command line tools that is compatible with your OS from [https://developer.android.com/studio\#command-tools](https://developer.android.com/studio#command-tools). Create a folder and extract the downloaded file into it.

### Tell Bubblewrap where the JDK and Android command line tools are

When running `bubblewrap` for the first time, it will ask where it can find the JDK and Android command line tools. So, take note of the location where both were decompressed.

### Updating the location of the JDK and / or the Android command line tools.

If the location for the JDK or the Android command line tools have been setup with the wrong path or if their location has changed after the initial configuration, the location for either of those can be changed by editing the configuration file at `${USER_HOME}/.llama-pack/llama-pack-config.json`.

## Quickstart Guide

### Installing Bubblewrap

    npm i -g @bubblewrap/cli

### Initializing an Android Project

Generate an Android project from an existing Web Manifest:

    bubblewrap init --manifest https://my-twa.com/manifest.json

When initalizing a project, Bubblewrap will download the Web Manifest and ask you to confirm the values that should be used when building the Android project.

It will also ask you for the details needed to generate a signing key, used to sign the app before uploading to the Play Store.

### Building the Android Project

    bubblewrap build

When building the project for the first time, the Android Build Tools will need to be installed. The tool will inkove the installation process for the build tools. Make sure to read and accept the license agreement before proceeding.

As a result of the build step, the tool will generate a signed APK (`app-release-signed.apk`) that can be uploaded to the Play Store. You will also need to deploy a Digital Asset Links file to validate your domain. The [TWA Quick Start Guide](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/08/twas-quickstart#creating-your-asset-link-file) explains how to extract the information needed to generate it.

## Commands

## `init`

Usage:

Initializes an Android project for Trusted Web Activity from a Web Manifest. The init script will parse the Web manifest and generate default valuers for the Android project, where possible. It will prompt the user to confirm or input values where one could not be generated.

    bubblewrap init --manifest="<web-manifest-url>" [--directory="<path-to-output-location>"]

Options:

* `--directory`: path where to generate the project. Defaults to the current directory.

## `build`

Builds the project into a final APK that can be uploaded to the Play Store.

Usage:

    bubblewrap build [--skipPwaValidation]

Options:

* `--skipPwaValidation`: skips validating the wrapped PWA against the Quality Criteria.

## `update`

Regenerates the Android project files from a `twa-manifest.json` file.

Usage:

    bubblewrap update [--appVersionName="<version-string>"] [--skipVersionUpgrade] [--manifest="<path-twa-manifest>"]

Options:

* `--appVersionName`: version name to be used on on the upgrade. Ignored if `--skipVersionUpgrade` is used.
* `--skipVersionUpgrade`: skips upgrading `appVersion` and `appVersionCode`.
* `--manifest`: directory where the client should look for `twa-manifest.json`.

## `validate`

Validates a PWA agains the Quality Criteria for being using in a Trusted Web Activity.

Usage:

    bubblewrap validate --url=[pwa-url]

## `help`

Displays a list of commands and options.

Usage:

    bubblewrap help
