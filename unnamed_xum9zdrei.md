**functor**

```haskell
class Functor f where  
    fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b  
    
(<$>) :: (Functor f) => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b  
f <$> x = fmap f x  
```

example:

```haskell
ghci> fmap (++"!") (Just "wisdom")  
Just "wisdom!"  
ghci> fmap (++"!") Nothing  
Nothing  
```

**applicative functor**

```haskell
class (Functor f) => Applicative f where  
    pure :: a -> f a  
    (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b    
```

example:

```haskell
ghci> max <$> Just 3 <*> Just 6  
Just 6  
ghci> max <$> Just 3 <*> Nothing  
Nothing  
```


**monoid**
 
 A monoid is when you have an associative binary function and a value which acts as an identity with respect to that function. When something acts as an identity with respect to a function, it means that when called with that function and some other value, the result is always equal to that other value. 1 is the identity with respect to * and [] is the identity with respect to ++. There are a lot of other monoids to be found in the world of Haskell, which is why the Monoid type class exists. It's for types which can act like monoids. Let's see how the type class is defined:
 
```haskell
class Monoid m where  
    mempty :: m  
    mappend :: m -> m -> m  
    mconcat :: [m] -> m  
    mconcat = foldr mappend mempty  
```



**monad**

```haskell
class Monad m where  
    return :: a -> m a  
  
    (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b  
  
    (>>) :: m a -> m b -> m b  
    x >> y = x >>= \_ -> y  
  
    fail :: String -> m a  
    fail msg = error msg   
```

`>>=` is pronounced as *bind*

example:

```haskell
ghci> return "WHAT" :: Maybe String  
Just "WHAT"  
ghci> Just 9 >>= \x -> return (x*10)  
Just 90  
ghci> Nothing >>= \x -> return (x*10)  
Nothing  
```
